How to use Brunswick Grotesque
------------------------------

Brunswick Grotesque's texture is enabled through the contextual alternates OpenType feature.

Stylistic sets 1–4 (with contextual alternates off) access individual width styles:

* ss01: condensed
* ss02: narrow
* ss03: wide
* ss04: extended
* no stylistic set selected: regular

* ss05: text setting (with contextual alternates on)
  (The text setting is a stylistic set which excludes condensed and extended widths from the mix. This makes the texture more mild and suitable for extended reading).

* discretionary ligatures: when turned on, enables the 'www' ligature.

Some bonus alternates can be accessed manually via the glyphs panel.

Happy typesetting! :–)
